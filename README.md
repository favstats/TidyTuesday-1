# TidyTuesday

These are the #TidyTuesday exercises divided into folders based on the date. In each folder, there is the original data, the script, & a file containing the final figure. My goal with this is to manipulate the data entirely in R. Also, I'm working on commenting my code better. Obviously there is a focus on using ggplot2 & the tidyverse where possible. In the README.md file, notes can be found about each exercise & the different scripts/figures produced. Links to the original source & graphic can be found at the bottom of each README.md.
