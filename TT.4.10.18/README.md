#TidyTuesday 4-10-18

4-10-18

Started with a simple scatter plot. I used facet wrap to group the plots by position. I wanted to get a look at the data. The hardest part was getting averages of each position based on the year. I'm having trouble applying RColorBrewer palettes to these #TidyTuesday challenges. I've used RColorBrewer in the past but it hasn't been clicking for me lately. Code is scatter.facet.Rmd. Plot is scatter.facet.pdf.
