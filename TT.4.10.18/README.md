#TidyTuesday 4-10-18

4-10-18

Started with a simple scatter plot. I used facet wrap to group the plots by position. I wanted to get a look at the data. The hardest part was getting averages of each position based on the year. I'm having trouble applying RColorBrewer palettes to these #TidyTuesday challenges. I've used RColorBrewer in the past but it hasn't been clicking for me lately. Code is scatter.facet.Rmd. Plot is scatter.facet.pdf.

In an effort to try something new, I googled ggplot2 images. I had forgotten about these ridgeline plots. I've always wanted to do one but never seemed to have data that worked with it. I did this one more for looks than anything else. I did two side by side plots: one shows the distribution of average salaries, the other shows the distribution of the intial data. I thought it might be an interesting comparison. Code is ridges.Rmd. Plot is ridges.avg.vs.norm.pdf.
