Started with a line plot of the top 10 average salaries by gender (line.plot.top10.png). Then I did a scatter plot with all the salaries by occupation & gender (scatter.all.png). Next was a box plot of all salaries by gender (boxplot.all.png). Then I did a plot with the top 10 individuals reporting. The point is colored by gender & the size refelects the average salary (top10.jobs.by.indiv2.png). Everything is in one script this time. Code - all.Rmd

I had a hard time finding something interesting to do with this data. The obvious trend is that women make less than men.
